#Deconvolution

This code tries to simulate the DeConvolution Network in Theano with the weights given in https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/DeconvNet. 

##Files

The file layers.py contains the implementation required for the full structure of the network.

The file DeConvNet.py contains the structure of the network as described in https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/DeconvNet using the layers implemented in layers.py.

## Pre-requisite

To run the network, it is required to have pickle and Theano installed.

## To run

To run the code just do:
```
python DeConvNet.py
```

##Latest updates

The code is still not fully optimised. To get the results similar to the ones in https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/DeconvNet, work is still going on.
