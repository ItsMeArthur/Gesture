#Gesture recognition

This folder contains the code done as a part of GSoC 2016. The aim of the project was to do gesture recognition. The two major segments in the project i.e video segmentation and gesture recognition are in the respective folders. The instructions to run the modules are given in the respective folder. For video segmentation, go to the fcn_basic folder in the video_seg folder.


The work is not fully complete. There is still work required to be done in the gesture recognition code. The system can be trained by plugging in appropriate dataset.
