Command to run the code: python main.py <videofilename>.mp4

Required libraries:
	opencv
	matplotlib
	numpy

Important Points:
	Folder OpenHandLeft contains the templates for the left hand but I am not using them right now
	If videofilename is not specified, it will capture from the webcamera 
	It is working for mp4 format, may or may not work for other formats
